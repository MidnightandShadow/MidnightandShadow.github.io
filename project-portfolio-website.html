					<h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
					<h3>Project Summary</h3>
					<p>I was first inspired to make my website by one of the leaders of the Northeastern Video Game Development Club. During his presentation about different approaches for networking, he demonstrated the advantages of setting up a digital portfolio for video game and/or programming-related professionals. Since then, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS through LinkedIn Learning and I programmed this very site.</p>
					<p>This project is thus my first foray into front-end web dev and therefore chock-full of visits to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">CSS-Tricks</a> and the like. I have strived to use the proper techniques I learned to ensure the site is easy to navigate, add content to, and responsive no matter what screen display sizes become the norm in the future.</p>
					<h3>Project Role(s)</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Programmed all the HTML and CSS</li>
						<li>Designed the site’s aesthetic</li>
						<li>Selected fonts and other media</li>
						<li>Gathered, organized, and reformatted images</li>
						<li>Wrote all the site’s content in English and Spanish</li>
						<li>Addressed accessibility concerns</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>What I Learned</h3>
					<p>This process showed me, first-hand, how much work is involved in creating a modern website from scratch. I’ve developed a new lens through which I now perceive the web. 
						 Due to the abundance of “no-coding” site-building tools popularized nowadays, I had previously overlooked front-end web development; but now, I have gained a new sense of appreciation for the field.  I’ve also experienced how freeing it is to fully customize every single element on a site.</p>
