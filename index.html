									<h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
									<p>Near the end of my freshman year, I set sight on creating my digital portfolio from scratch. Doing so introduced me to the world of front-end web development: a world I now have a much greater appreciation for. Creating this site has given me first-hand knowledge about that world, and with it, an evolving portfolio that will continue to track my progress as I further explore web dev and other fields.</p>

									<h3>Game Jams</h3>
									<p>During my first year at Northeastern University, I collaborated with fellow students from several nearby universities across four game jams. My role has mainly been to create the music, and occasionally the sound effects, that shape the games by adding an auditory dimension. More recently, I began implementing the audio into the games myself.</p>

								<h3>Software Engineer Intern</h3>
								<p>Instawork</p>
								<p>January 2023 - June 2023</p>
							</div>
							
							<div class="job-summary">
								<p>Throughout my internship at Instawork, I contributed value to both my coworkers and to the company's userbase across several programming and business-side domains. I simplified an Operations workflow to improve their productivity through a new feature. Similarly, I created a dynamic dashboard for a manager, enabling her to have a quicker overview of the information she needed as well as view metrics that she could not access before. Additionally, I documented my code thoroughly to assist my fellow programmers who might revisit it and I created extensive unit tests and manually tested user-facing flows in mobile simulators to better assist other programmers and QA with my new changes or fixes. On the user side, I fixed both backend and frontend-related bugs that had negatively impacted the user experience, and I implemented new features to simplify user flows.</p>
								<p>My work culminated in creating a v1 for a new, large, end-to-end feature. I incorporated the best patterns and practices I observed throughout my time at Instawork to cleanly integrate the new feature into the existing backend framework and front-end flow. I wrote a <a href="https://engineering.instawork.com/a-technical-approach-document-teardown-a6c957e05172" target="_blank">TAD (technical approach document)</a> to summarize my work and elaborate on how future extensions could most easily be implemented.</p>
