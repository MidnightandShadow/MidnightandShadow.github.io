									<h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
									<p>Near the end of my freshman year, I set sight on creating my digital portfolio from scratch. Doing so introduced me to the world of front-end web development: a world I now have a much greater appreciation for. Creating this site has given me first-hand knowledge about that world, and with it, an evolving portfolio that will continue to track my progress as I further explore web dev and other fields.</p>

									<h3>Game Jams</h3>
									<p>During my first year at Northeastern University, I collaborated with fellow students from several nearby universities across four game jams. My role has mainly been to create the music, and occasionally the sound effects, that shape the games by adding an auditory dimension. More recently, I began implementing the audio into the games myself.</p>

								<p>As a volunteer, I helped ensure local Floridians in need of food were provided with a selection of weekly groceries during Covid. My roles included: separating, organizing, and packaging vegetables; distributing the final packages to families’ cars; and adapting to new bottlenecks in the assembly line by assisting other stations and inter-station transport. In addition, I organized excess materials and dismantled booth equipment.</p>
