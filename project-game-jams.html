							<h3>Seaside Scramble - Husky Jam 2022</h3>
							<h4>Role: Music Composition and Audio Programming</h4>
							<p> <cite>Seaside Scramble</cite> is a turn-based tactics territory game centered around the 2022 Husky Jam’s theme of “Seaside.” The game has you commanding a group of land animals (who all happen to be cats) against a variety of sea creatures. In order to win the battle, you must claim more sand tiles than your opponents can claim sea tiles before time is up.</p>
							<p>The music takes inspiration from epic pirate films to set the scene for this shoreline battle. Through Wwise, the music endlessly re-orchestrates and partially re-sequences itself to keep the battle interesting. Additional programming lets it adapt to the tides of the battle: different musical elements become either more or less prominent in the track depending on how far you or your opponents are advancing.</p>

							<h3>There’s Always Space for Love - Slice of Jam 2022</h3>
							<h4>Role: Music</h4>
							<p> <cite>There’s Always Space for Love</cite> is a humorous Visual Novel Dating Simulator made for the 2022 Slice of Jam’s theme of “Deja Vu.” The theme is present in the game’s setting and character interactions, though to say any more would potentially spoil the narrative. The game takes place during a speed-dating event in a spaceship full of strange characters desperate to find love.</p>
							<p>The music was crafted to fit each individual character you meet during the event, as they each have very distinct appearances, personalities, and attitudes. The soundtrack ranges from jazzy and groovy to spooky and atmospheric depending on the current character the player is speaking with. Additionally, there is a climactic track for the epilogue that embodies both the outer space setting and the game’s fun and eccentric nature.</p>

							<h3>Duelity - Global Game Jam (Boston) 2022</h3>
							<h4>Role: Music and SFX</h4>
							<p> <cite>Duelity</cite> is an old-western dueling game that was made for the 2022 Global Game Jam’s theme of “duality”, a theme incorporated through the gameplay and story. The game is centered around the tale of Guy and Connor, a wild cowboy and his more diplomatic-minded brother. When Guy’s wife and daughter are taken hostage, Guy and Connor do all they can to get them back, albeit through very different methods.</p>
							<p>The music was made to suit the old-western film style of the game, as well as match the different intensities of the standoff negotiations playing as Connor versus the dueling playing as Guy. One track even takes into account the strange circumstance of Guy dueling a drunk opponent in a bar.</p>

							<h3>Sightless - Jam-O-Lantern 2021</h3>
							<h4>Role: Music and SFX</h4>
							<p> <cite>Sightless</cite> is a dark, atmospheric wave-based survival game made for the 2021 Jam-O-Lantern’s theme of “cursed.” You play as an eye that’s cursed to be shut and endlessly attacked by open eyes, which shoot lasers at you, slow you down as you try to evade incoming attacks, or otherwise impede your survival.</p>
							<p>The music was designed to match the dark, horror ambiance of the game yet still become frantic enough to match the wave-based combat. The haunting essence of the title theme was inspired by the soundtrack for HBO’s <cite>Chernobyl</cite> series and the major motif of the title theme was hidden in distinct elements of the combat tracks.</p>

							<h3>Ecna Lab Breaker - Ludum Dare 49</h3>
							<h4>Role: Music and SFX</h4>
							<p> <cite>Ecna Lab Breaker</cite> is a 2D Sidescroller with a Japanese, paper-like aesthetic made for Ludum Dare 49’s theme of “unstable.” The instability is implemented into the gameplay: you play as a clumsy swordsman who has to pace himself and attack precisely to remain standing.</p>
							<p>The music was made to match the calm-aesthetic landscape when out of combat and the epic old-school vibe during combat through Japanese-inspired Lo-Fi and orchestral music respectively.</p>
